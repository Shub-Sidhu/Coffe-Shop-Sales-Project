# Coffe-Shop-Sales-Project
A deep dive into coffee shop sales data to reveal customer trends and optimize performance. Explores sales patterns by day, time, and location, identifies the average spend per order, and highlights top-selling products by quantity and revenue. Insights will guide targeted  product strategy for maximized profitability.

OBJECTIVE:- The main objective of this project is to analyze retail sales data to gain actionable insights that will enhance the performance of the coffee shop.

RECOMMENDED ANALYSIS:- 
* How do sales vary by day of the week and hour of the day and across different store locations?
* Are there any peak times for sales activity?
* What is the total sales revenue for each month?
* What is the average price/order per person?
* Which products are the best-selling in terms of quantity and revenue?

RECOMMENDATIONS:-
We have observed a downward trend in sales after 10 a.m., as well as lower sales on weekends compared to weekdays. To address these challenges, we recommended implementing targeted strategies:-
* Introduce Weekend Specials, and offer limited-time discounts, promotions, or unique menu items on weekends to attract more customers and increase foot traffic.
* Create a Mid-Morning Incentive, to boost sales after 10 a.m., consider discounts on popular items, a loyalty reward for returning customers.
* Enhance Social Media Engagement.
* Build a cozy Atmosphere.
